DETAILED INTERFACE DESCRIPTION
==============================

T.1 Login and passwords settings
--------------------------------

In this dialog you can change various login and password settings. These
settings are mainly stored in the "/etc/login.defs" file.

T.1.1 Login
Various login settings.

T.1.1.A Seconds to wait after an incorrect login attempt [NUM]
Values: number <0,inf)

It is useful to wait some time after an incorrect login attempt
to prevent the passwords guessing. On the other hand, make the
time so small that if you mistype the password, you don't need
to wait to long. The sensible value is "3".

The secure setting is "3".
This box sets the variable FAIL_DELAY in /etc/login.defs.

T.1.1.B Record failed login attempts [X]
Values: "yes", "no".

It is useful to know if somebody is trying to log in and failed.
For example if someone is guessing password of other users.
By checking this option, you control if the failed login attempts
will be logged into the system logfile.

The secure setting is "yes".
This box sets the variable FAILLOG_ENAB in /etc/login.defs.

T.1.1.C Record successful login attempts [X]
Values: "yes", "no".

Even the successful login attempts logging can be useful. It can
show if somebody is using someone else's account.

The secure setting is "yes".
This box sets the variable LASTLOG_ENAB in /etc/login.defs.

T.1.2 Passwords
Various password settings.

T.1.2.A Checks for new passwords [X]
Values: "yes", "no".

It is wise to choose password not to be very dictionary words, usual
names or other simple things. By checking the box you set some checking
for password to not contain simple words which can be easily guessed.

The secure setting is "yes".
This box sets the variable PASSWD_USE_CRACKLIB in /etc/rc.config.

T.1.2.B Plausibility test for password [X]
Values: "yes", "no".

Sometimes it is even needed that password are enough strange words
that guessing is more hard. Check this box to enable additional
checks.

The secure setting is "yes".
This box sets the variable OBSCURE_CHECKS_ENAB in /etc/login.defs.

T.1.2.C Password length
Set the minimum and maximum password length.
This box sets the variable PASS_MIN_LEN in /etc/login.defs.
This box sets the variable PASS_MAX_LEN in /etc/login.defs.

T.1.2.D Days of password change warning
Set the minimum and maximum time for warning if the password must
be changed.
This box sets the variable PASS_MIN_DAYS in /etc/login.defs.
This box sets the variable PASS_MAX_DAYS in /etc/login.defs.

T.1.2.E Days before password expiry warning? :7

This entry sets the number of days the user is warned before his password
expiry. The longer time, the harder for the user guessing passwords.

The secure setting is "7".
This box sets the variable PASS_WARN_AGE in /etc/login.defs.


T.2 Boot settings
-----------------

T.2.1 How to interpret Ctrl-Alt-Del
Values: "ignore", "reboot", "halt".

When someone at the console has pressed the CTRL-ALT-DEL key
combination, the system usually reboots. Sometimes it is
desired to ignore this event, for example when the system
serves as both workstation and server.

The secure setting is "ignore".

This box sets the variable CONSOLE_SHUTDOW in /etc/rc.config.

T.2.1 Shutdown behaviour of KDM
Values: "root", "all", "none", "local".

With KDM you may decide who is allowed to shutdown the machine from KDM.
Here you may enter either "root", "all", "none", or "local" (only if the
user is locally logged in).

The secure setting is "root".

This box sets the variable KDM_SHUTDOWN in /etc/rc.config. There are more
variables for KDM in /etc/rc.config. See [??].

T.3 Miscellaneous settings
--------------------------

T.3.1 Setting of files premissions
Values: "easy", "secure", "paranoid".

Settings for the permissions of certain system files are set
according to the data in /etc/permissions.secure or
/etc/permissions.easy. Which file is used depends upon this
selection. Launching SuSEconfig sets these permissions
according to /etc/permissions.*. This fixes files with
incorrect permissions whether this occured accidentally or
by intruders.

"easy": For most of the system files that are only readable
  for root (via secure) are modified so that other users can
  also read these files.

"secure": Certain system files (e.g. /var/log/messages) can
  only be viewed by the user root. Some programs can only be
  launched by root or by daemons, not by an ordinary user.

"paranoid":  If you are really paranoid, use this setting.
  You must after that decide, which users will be able to
  run X applications and set-uid programs.

The secure setting is "secure".

This box sets the variable PERMISSION_SECURITY in /etc/rc.config.

T.3.2 User launching updatedb
Values: "nobody", "root".

The program updatedb runs regularly, once a day. It scans
your whole filesystem and creates a database (locatedb)
where the location of EVERY file is stored. The database can
be searched by the program "locate".

By setting this entry, you select the user to run this
command:

"nobody": only files which the user "nobody" can access
  are added into the database. All users can choose if the
  file will be in the database or not.

"root": all files in the system are added into the
  database

The secure setting is "nobody".

This box sets the variable RUN_UPDATEDB_AS in /etc/rc.config.

T.3.3 Omit current directory from the path of user root
Values: "yes", "no".

On a DOS system, executable files (programs), are first
searched for in the current directory, and in the current
path variable afterwards. In contrast, on a UNIX system they
are exclusively searched for via the search path (variable
PATH).

Some systems set up a 'workaround' by adding the dot (".")
to the search path, thus enabling files in the current path
to be found and executed. This is highly dangerous since you
may accidentally launch unknown programs in the current
directory instead of the usual system-wide files. As a
result, creating 'Trojan Horses' which exploit this weakness
and intrude your system is rather easy if you set this
option.

"yes": the user root always has to launch programs in the
  current directory prefixed with a "./". Example: "./configure".

"no": the dot (".") is attached to the end of the search
  path of root, making it the last to be searched.

The secure setting is "yes".

This box sets the variable CWD_IN_ROOT_PATH in /etc/rc.config.

T.3.4 Disable telnet for user root [X]
Values: "yes", "no".

It is not very wise to allow telnet for the user root. During
the telnet session the passwords are sent in the plain form,
so they can be stolen by the third-party. Check this box to
disable telnet for root.

The secure setting is "yes".
This box sets the variable ROOT_LOGIN_REMOTE in /etc/rc.config.

T.4 Adduser settings
--------------------

T.4.1 User ID limitations
Set the minimum and maximum possible user ID.
This box sets the variable UID_MIN in /etc/login.defs.
This box sets the variable UID_MAX in /etc/login.defs.

T.4.2 Group ID limitations
Set the minimum and maximum possible Group ID.
This box sets the variable GID_MIN in /etc/login.defs.
This box sets the variable GID_MAX in /etc/login.defs.
