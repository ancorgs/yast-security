When someone at the console has pressed the CTRL + ALT + DEL key
combination, the system usually reboots. Sometimes it is desirable
to ignore this event, for example, when the system serves as both
workstation and server.</p>") +

_("<p><b>Seconds to wait after an incorrect login attempt</b><br>
It is advisable to wait some time after an incorrect login attempt
to prevent password guessing. Make the time small
enough so users do not need to wait to retry
if a password is mistyped. A sensible value is '3' seconds.</p>
") +
_("<p><b>Record failed login attempts</b><br>
It is useful to know if somebody is trying to log in and failed.
For example, if someone is trying to guess the passwords of other users.
Check this option to specify whether failed login attempts
should be logged in the system log file.</p>

Logging succesful login attempts is useful.  It can help to warn
you of unauthorized access to the sysem (for example, a user logging
in from a different location than usual).</p>

password checking in regard to these rules.</p>

Sometimes it is required that passwords are constructed using a mixture
of characters. This makes the guessing of passwords very difficult.

passwords.</p>\n"),

Settings for the permissions of certain system files are set
according to the data in /etc/permissions.secure or
/etc/permissions.easy. Which file is used depends on this
selection. Launching SuSEconfig sets these permissions
according to /etc/permissions.*. This fixes files with
incorrect permissions, whether this occurred accidentally or
by intruders.

by root (via secure) are modified so other users can
also read these files.

only be viewed by the user root. Some programs can only be
launched by root or by daemons, not by an ordinary user.

You must decide which users will be able to
run X applications and setuid programs.

") +
_("<p><b>User launching updatedb</b><br>
The program updatedb runs regularly, once a day. It scans
your whole file system and creates a database (locatedb)
where the location of EVERY file is stored. The database can
be searched by the program \"locate\".
</p>
") +
_("<p>By setting this entry, you can select the user to run this
command:
</p>") +
_("<p>\"nobody\": only files that the user \"nobody\" can access
are added into the database. All users can choose if the
file will be in the database or not.
</p>") +
_("<p>\"root\": all files in the system are added into the
database
</p>") +
_("<p><b>Current directory in the root's path</b><br>
On a DOS system, executable files (programs) are first
searched for in the current directory and in the current
path variable afterwards. In contrast, on a UNIX system they
are exclusively searched for via the search path (variable
PATH).
</p>
") +
_("<p>Some systems set up a 'workaround' by adding the dot (\".\")
to the search path, thus enabling files in the current path
to be found and executed. This is highly dangerous since you
may accidentally launch unknown programs in the current
directory instead of the usual system-wide files. As a
result, creating 'Trojan Horses' which exploit this weakness
and intrude your system is rather easy if you set this
option.
</p>") +
_("<p>\"yes\": the dot (\".\") is attached to the end of the search
path of root, making it the last to be searched.
</p>") +
_("<p>\"no\": the user root always has to launch programs in the
current directory prefixed with a \"./\". Example: \"./configure\".
